# 🎬 Omar's Theater

**Ever watched a movie and had a question you couldn't ask anyone?**

You know that moment—you're watching a film, something confusing happens, and you want to ask "Wait, who is that character?" or "What just happened?" but you don't want to pause and Google it (spoilers!), and you definitely don't want to interrupt the person next to you.

**Omar's Theater solves that problem.**

## 🎯 What Is This?

Omar's Theater is an AI-powered movie streaming platform that lets you ask questions about what you're watching—**without spoilers, without interruptions, and without bothering anyone.**

Simply pause the movie, ask your question out loud (or type it), and get an instant, spoiler-free explanation based on exactly where you are in the film. The AI remembers your conversation, understands context, and even lets you jump back to moments it references.

**It's like having a movie expert sitting next to you, but one that never spoils the ending.**
